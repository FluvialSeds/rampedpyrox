Welcome to the RampedPyrox documentation
========================================

``rampedpyrox`` is a Python package for analyzing experimental kinetic data and accompanying chemical/isotope compositional information. ``rampedpyrox`` is especially suited for comparing kinetic and isotope results from ramped-temperature instruments such as Ramped PyrOx, RockEval, pyrolysis gc (pyGC), thermogravimitry (TGA), etc. This package converts measured time-series data into rate/activation energy distributions using a selection of reactive continuum models, including the Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM) for non-isothermal data. Additionally, this package calculates the range of rate/activation energy values associated with each isotope "fraction" and performs necessary isotope corrections (blank, mass balance, kinetic fractionation).

How to Cite
-----------
When analyzing data with ``rampedpyrox`` to be used in a peer-reviewed
journal, please cite this package as:

* J.D. Hemingway. *rampedpyrox*: open-source tools for thermoanalytical data analysis, 2016-, http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rampedpyrox [online; accessed |date|]

Additionally, please cite the following peer-reviewed manuscript describing the deveopment of the package and Ramped PyrOx data treatment:

* J.D. Hemingway et al. (2017) An inverse model to realte organic carbon reactivity and isotope composition using serial oxidation. *Biogeosciences*, **in prep**.

If using Ramped PyrOx data generated by the NOSAMS instrument, the following manuscript contains relevant information regarding blank carbon composition, isotope mass balance, and the magnitude of the kinetic isotope effect:

Package features
----------------
``rampedpyrox`` currently contains the following features relevant to non-isothermal kinetic analysis:

* Stores and plots thermogram data

* Performs first-order DAEM inverse model to estimate activation energy distributions, p(0,E)

  * Regularizes ("smoothes") p(0,E) using Tikhonov Regularization

    * Automated or user-defined regularization value

* Calculates subset of p(0,E) contained in each RPO collection fraction

  * Automatically blank-corrects inputted isotope values using any known blank carbon composition

  * Corrects measured :sup:`13`\ C/:sup:`12`\ C ratios for the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) during heating

* Calculates and stores model performance metrics and goodness of fit 
  statistics

* Generates plots of thermograms, p(0,E), and E vs. isotope values for each RPO fraction

* Allows for forward-modeling of any arbitrary time-temperature history, *e.g.* to determine the decomposition rates and isotope fractionation during geologic organic carbon matruation

Future Additions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Future versions of ``rampedpyrox`` will aim to include:

* Better support for isothermal experimental conditions

* Non-first-order kinetic models
