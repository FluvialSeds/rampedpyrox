About rampedpyrox
=================
``rampedpyrox`` is a Python package for analyzing experimental kinetic data and accompanying chemical/isotope compositional information. ``rampedpyrox`` is especially suited for analyzing results from ramped-temperature instruments such as Ramped PyrOx, RockEval, pyrolysis gc (pyGC), thermogravimitry (TGA), etc. This package converts time-series mass observations into rate/activation energy (E) distributions using a selection of reactive continuum models, including the Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM) for non-isothermal data. Additionally, this package correlates modelled rate/E data with measured isotope compositional data and corrects isotopes for kinetic fractionation, if appropriate.

This package was created as a supplement to J.D. Hemingway's PhD thesis awarded by the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography (December 2016), `which can be found here <https://github.com/FluvialSeds/thesis_master>`_.

Package features
----------------
``rampedpyrox`` currently contains the following features relevant to non-isothermal kinetic analysis:

* Stores and plots thermogram data

* Performs first-order DAEM inverse model to estimate activation energy distributions, p\ :sub:`0`\ (E)

  * Regularizes ("smoothes") p\ :sub:`0`\ (E) using Tikhonov Regularization

    * Automated or user-defined regularization value

* Calculates subset of p\ :sub:`0`\ (E) contained in each RPO collection fraction

  * Automatically blank-corrects inputted isotope values using any known blank carbon composition

  * Corrects measured :sup:`13`\ C/:sup:`12`\ C ratios for the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) during heating

* Calculates and stores model performance metrics and goodness of fit 
  statistics

* Generates plots of thermograms, p\ :sub:`0`\ (E), and E vs. isotope values for each RPO fraction

* Allows for forward-modeling of any arbitrary time-temperature history, *e.g.* to determine the decomposition rates and isotope fractionation during geologic organic carbon matruation

Future Additions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Future versions of ``rampedpyrox`` will aim to include:

* Better support for isothermal experimental conditions

* Non-first-order kinetic models
